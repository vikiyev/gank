## Tailwind Installation

Tailwind is a CSS framework that focuses on utility-first approach. Angular officially supports tailwind. We first need to install the tailwind package using `npm install -D tailwindcss`

We then create the configuration file using `npx tailwind init`. This creates a tailwind.config.js file in the root. We use the following config. The theme option contains properties for modifying colors, font sizes etc.

```js
module.exports = {
  content: ["./src/app/**/*.{html,js}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

To load tailwind into our project, we add the following into our styles.scss to inject the tailwind classes.

```scss
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```
